# JunctionModelForKitaevChains

We include the codes for the graphics presented in the work "A TS-S-TS Junction Model for Kitaev Chains".

The graphics **HI**, **II**, and **HIvsHM** were generated using the code written in `insulatingjunctiongraphics.m`, which includes:

- **HI.jpg**: The Josephson energy of the insulating junction as a function of the phase difference. The respective branches for n = 0, 1 are shown.
- **II.jpg**: The Josephson current of the insulating junction as a function of the phase difference. The respective branches for n = 0, 1 are shown.
- **HIvsHM.jpg**: A comparison between the Josephson energy of the insulating junction H_I and the effective superconducting energy contribution H_M as a function of the phase difference.

The graphics **HS** and **IS** were generated using the code written in `superconductingjunctiongraphics.m`, which includes:

- **HS.jpg**: The Josephson energy of the superconducting junction as a function of the phase difference and the superconducting phase of the junction phi_S.
- **IS.jpg**: The Josephson current of the superconducting junction as a function of the phase difference and the superconducting phase of the junction phi_S.

The graph **IS(phiS)** was generated using the code written in `superconductingcurrent_phiS.m`, which includes:

- **IS(phiS).jpg**: The Josephson current of the superconducting junction as a function of the superconducting phase of the junction phi_S for the difference phase values 0, pi/2 and pi.
